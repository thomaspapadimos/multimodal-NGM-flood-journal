# Flood-Related Multimedia Benchmark Evaluation: Challenges, Results and a Novel GNN Approach

By fusing the graph representations of text, image, and time, the approach achieves a comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the events being detected in social media. This innovative fusion method contributes to improve performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, as validated through rigorous experimentation. This methodology addresses the challenge of handling high-noise and low-sample labeled data, demonstrating robustness in scenarios where limited and noisy annotated data is available. The adaptability and effectiveness of the approach is a promising solution for real-time event detection in social media, offering a methodologically sound contribution to the field.
